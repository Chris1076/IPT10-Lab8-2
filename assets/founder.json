      "paragraph1": "BARBARA was born on December 4, 1907. Her birth was considered a high event, an appropriate justification for a Yuletide thanksgiving celebration. On Christmas Day, the family invited friends and relatives to witness the very charming way the baby girl would open her eyes and squint at the guests who were disarmed by the innocence of her smile.",
      "paragraph2": "The years passed very quickly and the infant blossomed into a lovable schoolgirl, earning credits for her mathematics prowess, and honors for her language proficiency. Averse to seeking for public recognition, Barbara was content with her silent victory over the curricular requirements. Upon graduation from high school, she informed her parents of her decision to pursue a degree in education.",
